      <h2>Whatâ€™s the problem?</h2>
      <p>A proposed 150-bed detox and transitional housing facility is being planned for 800 W Mission Road, directly between San Marcos Middle School, Palomar College, and Montessori programs.</p>

      <p>While we support the expansion of recovery treatment services in San Diego County, the current proposed location puts thousands of children or kids at risk due to increased traffic, proximity to high-security detox services, and lack of community engagement in the planning process.</p>

      <p>This project is being fast-tracked under Prop 1 funding using state-level zoning exemptions that bypass local reviewâ€”meaning parents and educators were never properly informed or consulted.</p>

      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>The proposed is within:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>25 feet from Montessori School of San Marcos</li>
        <li>25 feet from the Bus Stop for Paloma Elementary School</li>
        <li>100 feet from San Marcos Middle School</li>
        <li>500 feet from Palomar College</li>
        <li>500 feet from Palomar College Pre-School</li>
        <li>500 feet from Youth Sports Facilities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This location places thousands of students, children and adolescents at risk due to the proximity of a high-risk detox facility and the potential for individuals in active recovery to congregate near these educational and other youth recreational spaces.</p>
      <p>We need to act soon. This project is being fast-tracked FOR AN EARLY MAY APPROVAL TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION under Prop 1 funding using state-level zoning exemptions that bypass appropriate local reviewâ€”meaning parents and educators were never properly informed or consulted.</p>

      <p><strong>We respectfully request the San Marcos City Council and relevant authorities to relocate the proposed facility to a more suitable site in San Marcosâ€”one that is located away from schools, daycare centers, youth recreational areas, and any spaces frequented by children and adolescents.</strong></p>

      <p>Sign this petition today to demand a pause to the approval of funds under Prop 1 and delay any start to construction until relocation of the facility to a more appropriate locationâ€”one that both supports treatment AND protects our students.</p>

      <p>Together, we can support responsible development of an important drug and alcohol detox, in-patient rehab facility that benefits everyone without putting our children at risk.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can also reach out to the following representatives and officials to make your voice heard:</p>
