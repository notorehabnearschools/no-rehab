      <h2>What’s the problem?</h2>
      <p>A proposed 150-bed detox and transitional housing facility is being planned for 800 W Mission Road, directly between San Marcos Middle School, Palomar College, and multiple family neighborhoods and Montessori programs.</p>

      <p>While we support the expansion of recovery treatment services in San Diego County, the current proposed location puts thousands of students and local families at risk due to increased traffic, proximity to high-security detox services, and lack of community engagement in the planning process.</p>

      <p>This project is being fast-tracked under Prop 1 funding using state-level zoning exemptions that bypass local review—meaning residents, parents, and educators were never properly informed or consulted.</p>

      <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
      <p>Placing a high-volume detox and withdrawal management facility within walking distance of multiple schools, child care centers, and family housing creates serious public safety and traffic concerns. Mission Road is already congested with school traffic, and adding 24/7 staffing, medical transport, and visitors would overwhelm infrastructure and emergency access.</p>

      <p>This is not a question of whether these services are needed—we believe they are. But no recovery center should be built next to schools or homes without open community input.</p>

      <h4>Suggested Call Script:</h4>
      <blockquote>
        "Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I am a resident of San Marcos. I am calling to express my concern about the proposed Recovery & Wellness Campus at 800 W Mission Road. This 150-bed facility is planned adjacent to residential neighborhoods and several educational institutions, including:
        <ul>
          <li>San Marcos Middle School (approximately 0.5 miles away)</li>
          <li>Woodland Park Middle School (approximately 1 mile away)</li>
          <li>Palomar College (directly across the street)</li>
          <li>Montessori Preschool</li>
        </ul>
        The proximity to these schools raises concerns about student safety, increased traffic, and the lack of community input in the decision-making process. I urge [Assemblymember Patel/Senator Jones] to advocate for a pause in the project’s approval process, facilitate a formal public hearing, and request an independent safety and environmental impact assessment. Our community deserves a voice in decisions that directly affect our safety and well-being. Thank you."
